# Zelin Li | Personal Website

This is the repository for my personal website, built with [Astro](https://astro.build).

## Overview

- **Minimalist Design**: Inspired by Apple's clean, high-contrast aesthetics.
- **Bilingual Support**: Native English and Chinese (i18n) routing without heavy client-side plugins.
- **Performance First**: Zero unnecessary client-side JavaScript, leveraging Astro's static site generation.

## Development

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start local development server
npm run dev

# Build for production

```

## Deployment

This website is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions on every push to the `main` branch.
