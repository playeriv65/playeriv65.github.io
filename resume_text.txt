Research Experience
Muse Benchmark & EasyLocomo FrameworkNov 2025 – Present
•Co-authored"Muse"(ICML 2026 sub.); optimized synthetic data pipelines and conducted literature reviews
•Engineered"EasyLocomo"by unifying 5 model interfaces (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) into a single API wrapper;
Slashed dependency overhead by95%(from 200+ to <15 packages), improving reproducibility
•Benchmarked SOTA agents(MemAgent, HippoRAG, Kimi-Linear)across1,300+long-horizon interaction events
•Stack:Python, PyTorch, LLMs, OpenAI — github.com/playeriv65/EasyLocomo /external-link-alt

•Migrated MVP (FastAPI + Vanilla JS + SQLite) toSpring Boot + React + PostgreSQLfor maintainability and reuse
•Built cross-archCI/CDwith GitHub Actions and Docker (x86 Maven build + QEMU image assembly) for ARM64 deploys
•Designed anIndexedDBSync Manager with queue replay andUUID7ordering for offline conflict resolution
•Stack:Java, Spring Boot, React, PostgreSQL, IndexedDB, CI/CD, Docker — github.com/playeriv65/todo /external-link-alt
ACG: Auto-Chronicle Gaokao (State-Machine Narrative Engine)Jan 2026 – Present
•Built a120-weeknarrative state machine for Gaokao progression across rank, stress, fatigue, skills, and events
•Designed a3-stagepipeline (simulation→weekly scripts→chapters) for causal consistency and1M+chars
•Built amulti-agentclassroom framework with per-student traits, goals, and strategy updates
